Yelp API Library for Dart

Implements access to the [Yelp API v2](http://www.yelp.com/developers) using the *oauth* and *http* pub packages.

Currently only a rudimentary version of the Search API is implemented; the Business API is not.

NOTE: This is still under very early development and not usable yet.
